CREDITS & THANKS
----------------

The following people either helped make jPSXdec possible, or are just
really cool (usually both):

My dad, for everything he did for me (1949-2009).

Mike Melanson and Stuart Caie for adding STR decoding support to xine,
including the documentation in the source. Also for archiving some example STR
files.

The q-gears development team and forum members for their source code and
documentation. Their STR decoding source code PSXMDECDecoder.cpp was invaluable.

"Everything You Have Always Wanted to Know about the Playstation But
Were Afraid to Ask." Compiled / edited by Joshua Walker.
A valuable reference for any kind of PSX hacking, especially the PSX assembly
instruction set.

no$psx for his outstanding documentation of the PlayStation guts.
http://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm

smf, developer for MAME, for figuring out that everyone was getting the
order of CrCb wrong.
http://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/140003-M-A-M-E-Mr-Driller-DRI1-VER-A2-1000M-Mode-918-940-Nick-Vis?p=752883&viewfull=1#post752883

Gabriele Gorla for clarifying to me the details of the Cb/Cr swap error,
verifying that jPSXdec is doing things right, and for
pointing how the quantization table is uploaded to the MDEC.

Jonathan Atkins for his open source cdxa code and documentation.
http://freshmeat.net/projects/cdxa/

The PCSX Team, creators of one of the two open source PlayStation emulators.

The MAME emulator team for their efforts to document and accurately
emulate hardware, and for their license.
http://mamedev.org/

Developers of the pSX emulator for the very nice debugger for reverse
engineering games.
http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/

"Fyiro", the Japanese fellow that wrote the source code for the PsxMC
FF8 plugin.

T_chan for sharing a bit of his knowledge about the FF9 format.

The most excellent folks at IRCNet #lain :D

cclh12 at romhacking.net for generously providing some actual PlayStation 1
hardware RAM dumps.

Mezmorize at gshi.org for helping me get an old PlayStation and GameShark
working to make my own RAM dumps.

Jen (a.k.a. punistation) for her (formally) long standing PlayStation Serial
Experiments Lain page (rip http://www.geocities.com/punistation10/).

Yoshitoshi ABe et al. for Serial Experiments Lain and other captivating anime.

Andrew Z for pursuing high quality ADPCM decoding, and verifying jPSXdec
is doing an impeccable job.

John O. for verifying that jPSXdec video encoder is at least as good as
Sony's official SDK movconv tool.

Víctor González and Sergi Medina for the Spanish translation.

Gianluigi "Infrid" Cusimano for adding the Italian translation.

XBrav for adding support for Reboot video.

The Hitmen for releasing invaluable source code related to PSX hacking.

The countless people who created so many open source tools that I've used
in this project, and in my every day life. It is a huge list.

................................................................................
Thanks to those who wrote code that I've used or referenced at some point 
during development:

Alexander Strange for porting the ffmpeg simple_idct to Java.

Stephen Manley for generously sharing his DCT.java class.
http://www.nyx.net/~smanley/

Bernhard Huber for his very nice javadoc-templates.
http://members.aon.at/bhuber14/

ImageJ for its AVIWriter implementation.

Morten Nobel-Joergensen for the Java Image Scaling Library.
https://github.com/mortennobel/java-image-scaling

Doug Lea for sharing his Fraction.java class.

Sequence Point Software for the J2ME MPEG implementation of the IDCT.
https://bitbucket.org/sequencepoint/j2me_mpeg

Eclipse SWT for the Java JPEG implementation of the IDCT.

John E. Lloyd for the handy argparser library.
http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~lloyd/java/argparser.html

Joerg Anders for managing to write an mpeg1 decoder in pure Java.

The JSmooth tool http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/
The launch4j tool http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

PDFJet for their PDF library.

Jerry Huxtable for his awesome ParagraphLayout.

L2Fprod for the directory chooser.

Sun for the Java platform, SwingWorker and SwingX libraries,
and the Netbeans IDE.

Finally, a shout-out to all the PlayStation hackers who thought it was a good
idea to keep their decoders/emulators/hacking tools closed source, then
completely stop working on them. Extra recognition for those who now provide a
404 page for a web site.
