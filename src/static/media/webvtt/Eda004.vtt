Hello, Makino-san.

00:01.200 --> 00:02.420
It’s been a while.

00:02.720 --> 00:05.800
You don’t seem to be doing very well, so I’ll keep this short.

00:06.820 --> 00:10.360
Can you take responsibility for the things you say to us from now on?

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
Makino-san?

00:18.260 --> 00:24.640
I haven’t been able to sleep. I feel better when I’m looking at the computer.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.330
Smoking isn’t really allowed here, but if it relaxes you, go ahead.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.330
Let’s begin.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.850
The reason you’re here...

00:31.850 --> 00:33.290
It’s about Lain.

00:33.290 --> 00:37.170
Yes it is. Did you meet her after the shooting?

00:40.370 --> 00:41.240
Probably.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.530
Probably?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.120
I don’t know anymore.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.560
Detective, could you contact a psychiatrist for me?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.130
I can’t take it anymore.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.660
I don’t want to die, but all of a sudden, I want to die now!

00:59.180 --> 01:00.970
Look at these scars!

01:00.970 --> 01:02.970
There’s nowhere left to cut!

01:08.090 --> 01:09.850
This is interrogation room number 7.

01:09.850 --> 01:11.460
Bring a doctor here quickly.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.640
This one’s no good, either.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.480
Hey, cut it out!

01:17.640 --> 01:18.180
Sorry.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.410
Forget about the doctor.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.970
Bring a cleaner.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.210
And a cup of coffee, too.
