You are a counselor and a psychiatrist, Toko-san?

00:04.540 --> 00:07.350
And a psychiatrist is someone who heals mental illnesses?

00:07.800 --> 00:16.200
Uh huh. Put simply, I’m a doctor of the mind. As I mentioned before, mental illness is very complex.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.960
What is mental illness?

00:20.400 --> 00:29.500
Basically, a person’s mind becomes disturbed for some reason, and the person is unable to continue functioning.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.100
What sort of reason, for instance?

00:34.180 --> 00:35.360
There can be many reasons.

00:35.910 --> 00:42.440
Problems with a living environment or work environment can be reasons.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.600
Sudden, psychological shock can also be a reason.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.280
The sudden death of a well-loved pet can trigger mental illness.

00:52.180 --> 00:56.310
Sometimes people become mentally ill because of something that happens to them physically.

00:57.220 --> 01:00.060
A car accident or some other kind of physical trauma can be a cause.

01:00.540 --> 01:03.740
Also, people who drink too much can damage the function of their brains.

01:04.350 --> 01:05.560
Alcoholism?

01:05.830 --> 01:06.320
Exactly.

01:06.540 --> 01:07.760
You’ve been studying!

01:08.840 --> 01:12.950
If you drink too much the alcohol content in your blood will rise.

01:13.550 --> 01:16.510
You’ve seen drunk people wobble around without balance, haven’t you?

01:17.420 --> 01:20.990
They’re in an alcoholic stupor.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.080
But normal people aren’t that way, are they?

01:24.320 --> 01:25.680
No, they can be.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.550
It takes about 24 hours for alcohol to leave the human body.

01:30.480 --> 01:39.030
If you drink a lot everyday for a year or so—if you stay drunk long enough—you’ll your perception will start to change.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.200
Your brain will start to deteriorate.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.560
That’s scary.

01:44.740 --> 01:49.100
It is scary. I still have some sake now and then, though.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.840
Isn’t that dangerous?

01:51.280 --> 01:51.590
Ha, ha.

01:51.670 --> 01:52.420
Oh, a little bit.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.920
And smoking is bad too.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.740
But having a drink with friends every now and then can help relieve stress.

01:59.750 --> 02:04.280
Relieving stress is very important for the body’s health.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.140
I don’t understand what stress is.

02:09.950 --> 02:12.760
Remember when you didn’t like coming here at first?

02:13.460 --> 02:13.800
Yes.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.860
Stress is what we call the cause of that discomfort.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.070
You’re glad that the discomfort is gone, aren’t you?

02:20.900 --> 02:23.310
Yes. What other kinds of mental illness are there?

02:24.230 --> 02:29.140
Could you excuse me? I’ve been talking so much and I’m a little thirsty.
