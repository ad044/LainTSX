00:00.440 --> 00:01.250
I see.

00:01.700 --> 00:04.840
That’s probably because you are a strong person.

00:05.300 --> 00:11.440
I think I was probably weak and that I was trying to run away because of it.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.570
Do you think I’m trying to run away from myself?

00:15.100 --> 00:20.090
I don’t think so. But you want to change yourself, don’t you?

00:20.810 --> 00:24.420
I just don’t want to see any more bad dreams. I think that's how i feel.

00:26.010 --> 00:31.060
Could it be that you don’t want to be the person who sees the bad dreams?

00:31.280 --> 00:33.260
Maybe you feel that way somewhere deep inside yourself?

00:33.480 --> 00:38.410
Could it be that you are subconsciously trying to construct a "me" that isn’t "me"?

00:39.180 --> 00:41.560
What should I do?

00:41.880 --> 00:47.000
Do you think you can accept your dreams?

00:47.880 --> 00:48.900
Accept?

00:48.900 --> 00:49.540
Right.

00:50.220 --> 00:57.820
I mean facing the "you" that you don’t want to meet or hear, and then trying to become friends with them.

00:59.020 --> 00:59.970
I can’t.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.160
I think that all you have to do is listen to the voices.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.300
See what they are saying and see what they want to do.

01:07.250 --> 01:10.460
Face them until you understand them and expose them.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.210
I’m scared.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.800
But you’ve made it so far.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.930
You’re still you.

01:19.610 --> 01:24.980
You’ve never had a ghost punch you or had a voice act violently with you, right?

01:25.680 --> 01:29.130
Maybe these ghosts and voices are trying to be friends with you.

01:30.100 --> 01:30.850
Ha, ha.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.560
If you don’t see the ghosts again, great.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.210
But I if you do see them, I think that it’s important that you have a good attitude and know how to brace yourself.

01:37.970 --> 01:41.250
If the ghosts show up, just shake it off your shoulders and say, "oh, here they are again."

01:41.930 --> 01:44.130
I’m leaving. I’m going home.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.640
Why? Did I say something I shouldn’t have?

01:48.250 --> 01:54.700
I didn’t lie to you. I didn’t see any ghosts or phantoms. You’re a big jerk!

01:55.610 --> 01:56.560
Lain!
