The ring that Yoshida-kun bought me... Could this be... he gave it to me without saying anything.

00:12.870 --> 00:13.840
But that’s okay.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.890
I won’t make the same mistake.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.600
I haven’t produced any research results either.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.930
My own pride won’t let me leave my work at the lab now.

00:26.140 --> 00:29.530
I asked Lain a dumb question today.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.830
I asked her, "Who are you?

00:35.410 --> 00:42.740
Are you really Lain?" Without changing her expression but looking upward, she said, "I’m me."

00:44.820 --> 00:46.870
A question with such an obvious answer.

00:48.430 --> 00:53.230
Still, before even thinking about it, my mouth was open.

00:54.610 --> 00:55.460
I wonder why.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.090
I think Lain is probably tired of it, too.

01:00.650 --> 01:01.210
I know.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.270
It has to do with the girl I’ve been seeing in my dreams lately who looks a lot like Lain.

01:06.180 --> 01:08.570
She looks like Lain, but she isn’t her.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.780
I better straighten my mind out.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.540
Otherwise I won’t be much of a counselor.
