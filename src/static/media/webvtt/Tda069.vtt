00:00.360 --> 00:02.640
Lately I’ve been seeing bad dreams.

00:03.910 --> 00:07.870
I dreamed that I married Yoshida-kun and that Takeshi-san was saddened by it.

00:09.260 --> 00:12.990
I looked at Takeshi-san and started to laugh.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.660
These aren’t the kind of things that I would want.

00:18.650 --> 00:22.830
Maybe there’s a part of my subconscious where I want these things.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.800
But I don’t want my child to look exactly like Lain.

00:28.810 --> 00:34.930
I think that Lain is a good girl, but I don’t want my own child to be like her.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.070
Why?

00:40.810 --> 00:42.120
Why, Toko?

00:42.890 --> 00:45.410
I don’t know, but I can’t love her.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.930
I just can’t approve of it.

00:49.190 --> 00:51.930
What am I really thinking?

00:53.670 --> 00:57.190
I’m losing confidence in my own feelings.

00:59.590 --> 01:03.550
More and more I can’t tell reality apart from my dreams.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.140
Is this a delusion, too?

01:07.740 --> 01:09.600
Am I seeing hallucinations?

01:12.330 --> 01:13.260
That can’t be.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.280
I’ve become psychologically hypersensitive.

01:16.870 --> 01:18.630
You’re ok, Toko.

01:19.990 --> 01:23.330
I should use the new machine Yoshida-kun gave me.

01:24.940 --> 01:29.500
Since he helped me, I should at least repay him by cooperating with his experiments.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.450
If I lose him now.

01:32.990 --> 01:36.180
I’ll be in a horrible place psychologically.

01:37.220 --> 01:40.140
I can’t go to a horrible place now.
