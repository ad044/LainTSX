I wondered if your name has anything to do with R. D. Laing. Oh, it couldn’t, could it?

00:05.940 --> 00:07.110
R.D. Laing?

00:07.580 --> 00:08.440
It’s a person’s name.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.040
An English psychiatrist.

00:11.390 --> 00:12.540
He was an unusual person.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.100
The titles of some of his books are very interesting.

00:16.990 --> 00:19.110
One of them is: "Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you really love me?"

00:19.900 --> 00:21.390
"I Love, Love, Really Love"?

00:21.840 --> 00:34.750
I read it when I was in college and I don’t remember much of it, but it’s about two lovers—a man and a woman—and the woman asks the man if he loves her.

00:35.240 --> 00:35.820
And?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.500
Well of course, the man replies that he loves her.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.680
But the woman isn't satisfied, and asks more and more questions.

00:44.390 --> 00:45.470
I don’t understand.

00:46.300 --> 00:50.720
OK. Let’s see. Do you like me, Lain?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.340
Yes, I do.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.160
More than your dad? More than your mom?

00:56.070 --> 00:56.310
Yes.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.680
That makes me happy. Do you mean it?

00:59.300 --> 00:59.870
Yes I do.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.680
Are you happy when you’re here?

01:03.500 --> 01:06.740
I don’t really understand, but I probably am.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.140
Do you like talking to me?

01:09.920 --> 01:10.190
Yes.

01:10.910 --> 01:12.180
What do you like about me?

01:13.220 --> 01:17.320
You’re kind and you listen to me.

01:18.180 --> 01:21.750
Which do you like more? That I’m kind, or that I listen?

01:22.680 --> 01:23.320
Which?

01:23.780 --> 01:24.720
Yes, which?

01:25.680 --> 01:26.840
I like you because you’re kind.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.240
How am I kind to you?

01:31.100 --> 01:33.470
You don’t get angry and you’re polite.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.780
But there are lots of people besides me who don’t get angry at you.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.220
There are lots of people who are polite to you.

01:39.220 --> 01:39.550
Aren’t there?

01:40.380 --> 01:42.670
Do you really like me?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.150
I don’t really know.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.660
Do I have to think about all this stuff?

01:48.360 --> 01:49.420
Let’s stop this.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.500
I feel like I might start to not like you.
