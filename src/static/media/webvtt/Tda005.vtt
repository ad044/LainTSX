Today I took a walk with Takeshi-san along the Charles River.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.070
I reflected on the four years that I’ve spent here.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.940
At first I was elated, but things were tough until I met Takeshi-san.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.050
I think I’ve changed a lot since I met him.

00:18.290 --> 00:22.610
I suppose it wasn’t time for romance, but being alone was a downer.

00:23.930 --> 00:26.940
When you feel down you want someone to be around you.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.560
But it doesn’t mean that you ought to seek out a boyfriend thoughtlessly just because you’re feeling sad.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.980
I’ve gotten my feelings hurt a few times that way.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.320
But Takeshi-san is different.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.760
I feel safe just being with him.

00:44.850 --> 00:47.230
I think it’s the first time I’ve felt this way.

00:49.590 --> 00:53.410
Next year Takeshi-san will return to Japan and enter a research center there.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.720
What will happen to me?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.640
I would love to work in the same research center as Takeshi-san.
