00:00.850 --> 00:04.360
So... Ms. Iwakura, please wait there in the waiting room.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.120
Lain, you don’t have to worry so much.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.000
Please sit down there.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.680
Ah... do you want some juice or something else to drink?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.980
It's fine if you don't want any. Don't worry.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.860
Let's see...

00:21.200 --> 00:26.620
I'm thirsty, so I'm going for tea... Would you mind joining me?

00:27.290 --> 00:30.080
Because it will look funny if only I drink it.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.360
Thank you.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.570
Which one do you want?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.640
We have many to choose from.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.090
The same as you.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.020
Black tea?

00:40.570 --> 00:41.370
Got it.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.360
Just a moment...

00:45.250 --> 00:47.980
You can put the sugar and milk in it if you want.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.960
Here you go.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.080
Not bad, huh?

00:56.100 --> 01:00.850
Earl Grey tea, I really love it.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.410
Earl Grey?

01:02.410 --> 01:02.890
Right.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.980
Even with tea there are lots of kinds, with different smells and tastes.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.480
Does it taste good?

01:11.170 --> 01:12.480
Well...

01:12.930 --> 01:15.080
It suits my taste.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.860
But I'm not sure about you, Lain.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.650
If you want to, you can drink a little bit.

01:19.970 --> 01:23.040
If it’s not to your taste, I can make something else for you.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.730
Here...
