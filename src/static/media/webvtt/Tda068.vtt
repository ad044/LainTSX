00:00.370 --> 00:03.030
I had dinner with Yoshida-kun today.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.560
I feel that I was more composed today thanks to him.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.800
I wonder why he is so kind to me.

00:12.090 --> 00:16.420
Maybe he’s heard the gossip going on about me and is siding with me.

00:18.410 --> 00:21.090
Could it be more than siding with me?

00:21.510 --> 00:23.090
Could he be in love with me?

00:25.190 --> 00:26.020
I don’t know.

00:27.130 --> 00:32.450
But I’m looking for love.

00:33.590 --> 00:36.190
I don’t mean that I would want to love anyone.

00:37.860 --> 00:42.730
I liked Yoshida-kun from the time that I met him.

00:44.950 --> 00:46.110
That’s not entirely true.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.800
I’m just sad right now.

00:50.590 --> 00:53.020
It’s sad to be alone.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.160
I want someone to comfort me.
