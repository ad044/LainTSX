00:00.000 --> 00:01.080
A rumor?

00:01.550 --> 00:02.800
Does it bother you?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.950
Someone is spreading rumors about you?

00:06.300 --> 00:07.850
Is that a delusion of persecution?

00:07.850 --> 00:09.960
Some other kind of delusion?

00:10.490 --> 00:14.840
Well, it might just be a lack of self-confidence.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.750
Why do you have so much confidence, even when you’re sick, Lain?

00:20.750 --> 00:32.040
I’m sick. What’s the name of my disease? Schizophrenia? Manic depression? Something else?

00:32.860 --> 00:42.060
You aren’t any of those things.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.410
You have pathomimesis.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.800
That’s what you call the imitation of disease.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.120
Then I’m not really sick?

00:49.120 --> 00:53.680
You don’t exist.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.190
I just think that you’re here.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.620
Everyone has been tricked.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.280
We’ve all been shown some glimpse of your existence.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.680
That’s why no one really remembers you.

01:03.680 --> 01:13.000
It’s not like you to be mad. Some of us don’t seem to exist, though. Which are you?

01:13.530 --> 01:16.160
I think that you think I’m here.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.560
You’re a delusion that created a delusion.

01:18.560 --> 01:24.400
All these things, your constructed diseases and your voices, are delusions.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.780
How about me? Am I here?

01:26.780 --> 01:30.360
That’s why I have to heal you!

01:30.360 --> 01:35.400
You’re so serious. But you’re an elite. You’ve been chosen.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.110
That’s right.

01:36.110 --> 01:38.440
I’m trying hard to be here.

01:38.440 --> 01:45.640
I would rather have been out playing and fooling around, but I’ve gone to school and studied and worked hard to get here.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.640
I feel sorry for you, Touko-san.
