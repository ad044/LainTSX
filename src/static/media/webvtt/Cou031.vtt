00:01.520 --> 00:04.520
There are different kinds of memories.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.420
First of all, there’s one’s memory of oneself.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.040
You know what self- understanding is?

00:10.560 --> 00:14.040
You know that you are a girl named Lain with a certain face and height and weight?

00:14.420 --> 00:16.960
That’s all recorded at a molecular level.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.900
Aside from the brain, there are places throughout the body that carry residues of things that have happened.

00:23.480 --> 00:29.160
You know that if you get cut, you bleed, but if you wait a while, it gets scab and heals?

00:29.840 --> 00:33.660
That has to do with information stored in cells going to work.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.760
Take a look at athletes and people who have gone through intense physical training.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.860
They seem to do things effortlessly.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.540
That’s because their bodies have their own recollection or memory.

00:45.140 --> 00:48.020
If you generate a recording, you have a memory?

00:48.540 --> 00:52.840
You might be able to say that sometimes, but not always.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.420
Humans are haphazard and unpredictable, aren’t they?

00:55.520 --> 00:58.980
I don’t remember everything that happened to me as a kid precisely.

00:59.560 --> 01:05.120
I have happy memories of times I spent with my family, but my family might not have happy memories of those times at all.

01:05.380 --> 01:10.800
I may have had misperceptions in the moment, or I may have remembered things incorrectly and by mistake.

01:11.700 --> 01:16.100
But we all walk around with memories, thinking that what we remember is what actually happened.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.680
Suppose you meet an old friend that you haven’t seen in a long time.

01:19.820 --> 01:25.000
Don’t you remember the things you used to do with that person right away?

01:25.860 --> 01:30.980
Your memory has a way of linking things together.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.880
If you can’t link things together, you’re sick?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.700
Well, there is something called memory impediment.

01:37.700 --> 01:43.020
People who have this can’t remember things that happened only moments ago.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.000
They have no idea of how things in the past took place.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.160
They don’t know what happened and in what order.

01:47.160 --> 01:52.020
Since they don’t want anyone to know that they don’t remember things, they often make up stories about the past to fool people.

01:52.020 --> 01:54.340
Humans are complex.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.700
We do all sorts of things.

01:56.460 --> 02:00.600
You’ve seen senile old people on TV shows, haven’t you?

02:01.280 --> 02:05.100
As humans, there are some things we can’t do anything about.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.480
Things we can’t do anything about?

02:07.600 --> 02:10.800
I’m not saying that you’re sick, Lain.

02:11.060 --> 02:13.900
There are things we can’t do anything about, aren’t there?

02:14.440 --> 02:16.420
We can’t flap our arms and fly, can we?

02:16.960 --> 02:19.620
There are memories in the body and the brain?

02:19.980 --> 02:23.600
There are still many things we don’t understand.

02:24.020 --> 02:29.360
The human brain is made up of many different things.

02:30.220 --> 02:36.460
When something is recorded there, there is a change that takes place that becomes the foundation for memories.

02:37.140 --> 02:38.460
I don’t understand.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.540
Yeah.

02:40.540 --> 02:44.340
When you go to high school and college, you can study up on all this stuff.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.540
But it’s good that you have a healthy curiosity.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.320
I don’t think you’re sick, Lain.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.680
I feel that my memories aren’t my memories.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.700
Sure! I feel that way sometimes, too.

03:00.020 --> 03:04.040
Even when it’s me. But I don’t remember anything else.

03:04.140 --> 03:07.940
You’ve just forgotten something, that’s all.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.660
Didn’t I say that human beings are haphazard and unpredictable?

03:10.900 --> 03:15.240
We remember things the way we want to remember them and often forget what we want to.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.440
That’s being human.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.380
That’s normal.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.920
Normal?

03:19.060 --> 03:23.660
Yes. You dwell on things too much, Lain. All those things are normal.
