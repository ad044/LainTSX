Hello Lain, have you been well?

00:03.560 --> 00:05.380
Yes, and you?

00:05.560 --> 00:09.640
Yes, I’ve been fine. I’m a bit tired though.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.300
Tired?

00:11.300 --> 00:15.000
Yes, I’ve been pretty busy.

00:15.370 --> 00:16.330
How busy?

00:16.620 --> 00:24.330
Hmm, well... At least talking with you like this is something I can look forward to.

00:24.810 --> 00:25.520
Really?

00:25.520 --> 00:31.180
Really! What shall we talk about today... What do you want to talk about Lain?

00:32.180 --> 00:36.160
We couldn't talk that much about you last month.

00:37.010 --> 00:42.860
I’d rather talk about you, Lain; not about myself, though.

00:44.170 --> 00:51.960
But you’re right, it’s only fair that we both get to talk about what we want, so this time we’ll talk about me, but next time we’ll talk about you Lain, is that all right?

00:52.290 --> 00:52.920
OK!

00:53.900 --> 01:08.520
I’m not sure where I should start though... My name is Younera Touko, I’m 27, I’m a doctor at the Tokyo Research Institute for Psychotherapy... That's all about me.

01:09.930 --> 01:12.980
Ah, we won’t get anywhere like this.

01:14.020 --> 01:20.800
You know, I’m used to listening people talk, not used to talking myself.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.170
Is there anything you’d like to know Lain?

01:24.640 --> 01:26.410
How did you become a doctor?

01:26.660 --> 01:30.640
I studied a lot at a place called a university.

01:30.640 --> 01:37.140
I wrote something called a thesis, and with that I received my degree to become a doctor.
