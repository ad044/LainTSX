00:00.000 --> 00:04.290
I wonder how many times I’ve met with Lain so far.

00:05.380 --> 00:10.610
She sometimes struggles with hallucinations, but they don’t seem to be worsening.

00:11.840 --> 00:17.820
Seeing hallucinations must be a very difficult thing for her.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.710
She's not the kind of kid that should be gloomy.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.370
I wonder if she's having a hard time at school.

00:26.220 --> 00:32.250
Her mother told me that she isn’t being bullied.

00:33.570 --> 00:38.280
When I mention school, Lain tends to go quiet.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.800
Maybe I should ask some of her friends at school how she’s doing.

00:45.570 --> 00:50.910
I think the kind of bullying that happens in schools now is different from the kind that took place when I was younger.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.650
I wish I could help you, Lain.

00:57.340 --> 01:03.020
I feel depressed when I see Lain.

01:03.680 --> 01:13.140
I can't help feeling depressed, but it’s when I get that way that Professor Takashima always complains to me about stupid stuff.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.510
Ahh!

01:15.880 --> 01:17.860
Tomorrow I have the day off.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.860
I’ll go out on the town and have a good time.
