00:00.770 --> 00:03.330
Let’s skip counseling today and just relax instead.

00:04.280 --> 00:05.260
You came all the way out here.

00:05.260 --> 00:05.980
Do you want something to drink?

00:06.730 --> 00:09.840
I cried so much that I’m thirsty.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.930
Toko-san, I’ll start keeping my diary. Honestly, this time.

00:16.490 --> 00:20.290
Don’t force yourself. You’re a kind girl.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.280
I’m not forcing myself.

00:22.970 --> 00:24.120
The diary is for me, after all.

00:25.340 --> 00:30.130
And the next time I hear the voices, I’ll listen to see what they are saying.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.980
Then, I’ll tell you what they said, Toko-san.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.620
Thank you, Lain.

00:37.410 --> 00:42.120
Happy birthday, by the way, Toko-san.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.170
Huh! My birthday?

00:46.560 --> 00:49.560
I made this for you with my mom.

00:49.970 --> 00:54.240
Really? I’m so happy! Can I open it?

00:54.650 --> 00:55.280
Sure.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.610
Cookies! Good timing. We were actually out of teacakes. Let's have them together.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.000
Is it good?

01:07.320 --> 01:11.450
Mmm. It tastes like tea.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.820
You said that you like tea, so we made the cookies that way.

01:16.090 --> 01:20.660
Thank you. But then we better have a different kind of tea.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.450
It won’t go with black tea?

01:22.450 --> 01:27.740
No, not that it wouldn’t go with it, but it would be too bad if would couldn’t enjoy the tea and cookies as much as possible.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.100
Should I have made cookies with a different flavor?

01:30.650 --> 01:31.920
Oh, no, no.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.530
Not at all!

01:32.780 --> 01:38.770
But you took all the trouble to make such nice cookies, and I want to enjoy them as much as possible.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.460
That’s all.

01:41.210 --> 01:41.920
Really?

01:42.060 --> 01:45.850
Really. Thanks so much, Lain.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.280
Sensei, it hurts.
