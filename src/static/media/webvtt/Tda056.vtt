Today on my way home from the lab, I ran into Yoshida-kun.

00:05.110 --> 00:13.000
Lately, I had been so busy with helping Professor Takashima that I didn’t have time to talk to Yoshida-kun even when he visited the lab.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.900
He seems to have been worried about me, and was waiting for me at the lab until I was through with work.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.420
I don't want him to be too kind to me right now, when I’m feeling so irritable.

00:22.780 --> 00:30.040
I feel like blaming someone for what’s been going on, and I feel that if someone is kind to me, my feelings for Takeshi-san will crumble.

00:31.940 --> 00:38.490
Yoshida-kun just quietly walked me home, but he made me very happy.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.170
There was a "me" that was happy then.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.180
No.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.600
I shouldn’t feel this way.

00:48.460 --> 00:50.320
Takeshi-san is the one I like.

00:51.220 --> 00:55.500
Any woman would be happy if a attractive guy like him was nice to her, wouldn't she?

00:57.020 --> 01:01.050
Takeshi-san... I want you to catch me.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.650
I really am tired.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.260
I think I should use RML a little longer.
