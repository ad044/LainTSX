00:00.000 --> 00:04.330
Today I think I felt the way a person feels when she wants to die.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.960
I was placed in the same class as Kyoko-chan.

00:09.520 --> 00:18.510
I used to think that I would never feel badly facing Kyoko-chan again, but I became the person I used to be as soon as I saw her.

00:19.410 --> 00:25.280
Kyoko-chan walked past me as if I wasn’t there and started talking to other kids.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.510
I’m sure she talks about me a lot.

00:29.060 --> 00:32.070
It can’t be helped.

00:32.690 --> 00:36.120
It’s true that I’m the depressing, strange kid who misses school.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.370
I want to move to another school, too.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.370
I want to disappear.
