00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
I became emotional at Harumi’s wedding.

00:04.280 --> 00:07.300
I’ve never seen her look so pretty.

00:08.480 --> 00:12.310
She said she was going on her honeymoon to have a baby right away.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.580
I’m glad that she seemed so happy.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.300
I love to see wedding dresses.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.980
Weddings in churches are so romantic.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.910
There were over 100 invited people attending the reception.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.750
I’ve never been to such a large wedding crowd.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.930
Oh, when will I be as happy as Harumi?

00:43.290 --> 00:51.560
It was unfortunate that although there were many people at the wedding who knew each other, there weren’t many people for me to talk to.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.070
And Takeshi-san couldn’t come.

00:55.070 --> 00:57.520
Kanoko couldn’t, either.

00:59.120 --> 01:06.070
I know that people living in a society like this have a lot of things they have to do, but I feel that they should make time to go to their friend’s wedding.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.840
Ah, well.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.840
I shouldn’t complain.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.200
I’d want all my friends to attend my wedding.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.120
I guess I really do want to get married.
