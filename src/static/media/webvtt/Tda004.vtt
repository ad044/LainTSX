00:00.200 --> 00:00.890
Hmm.

00:01.220 --> 00:03.610
It’s almost Halloween again.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.260
It’ll be my last Halloween here.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.870
Halloween surprised me at first.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.700
People would walk around in costumes day and night, having lunch and shopping as if everything was as usual.

00:17.870 --> 00:21.220
People would come out in frightening costumes at night.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.930
I used to go out in a costume with my college friends too.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.840
I think Takeshi-san isn’t into that kind of thing.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.740
I’ve never seen him in a costume.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.270
It would be fun if we could go out in costumes together.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.210
I wonder what kind of costume I’ll wear this year.

00:44.460 --> 00:53.490
When I see Jack-o-lanterns on Halloween night, I sometimes wish I could just stay here and live with Takeshi-san.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.230
Hee, hee.
