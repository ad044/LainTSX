00:00.110 --> 00:02.950
If you had to guess, what could it be?

00:02.950 --> 00:04.510
Hmm.

00:04.510 --> 00:10.000
There is a delusion some people have that they are being influenced by something.

00:10.620 --> 00:15.000
The delusion that the radio or TV or cell phones are trying to influence them somehow.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.170
The delusion that TV and cell phones have the power to touch them physically.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.880
You said that you thought you were being touched by something, didn’t you, Lain?

00:29.880 --> 00:30.730
Uh, huh.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.240
It might not even be a delusion.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.330
There is an actual medical condition that makes people very sensitive physically.

00:36.330 --> 00:41.550
But you said that you don’t feel like you are yourself, didn’t you, Lain?

00:41.550 --> 00:46.040
That makes me think that you have the delusion that nothing exists.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.530
That you think you aren’t real and that existence isn’t real.

00:49.530 --> 00:53.620
This can come as the result of poor self-esteem.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.800
Poor self-esteem?

00:55.800 --> 01:01.110
It’s the feeling that one is worthless.

01:01.110 --> 01:05.110
It’s similar to the delusion of persecution we were talking about.

01:05.660 --> 01:09.800
I’m really sick.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.040
There are other kinds of delusions.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.460
I don’t want to listen anymore.

01:12.460 --> 01:18.280
Some people have the delusion that they have a special, unique sickness.

01:18.280 --> 01:23.020
It’s the sickness of thinking they have a sickness, when they really aren’t sick.

01:23.930 --> 01:30.220
I think that what you have, Lain, is mostly to do with this kind of delusion.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.800
The sickness of thinking that I am sick when I’m not sick?

01:33.800 --> 01:34.910
Yes.

01:34.910 --> 01:41.800
I think that you have poor self-esteem, and that a small insecurity manifests itself in nightmares, and makes you think that you are sick.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.170
Can I be cured?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.510
Sure!

01:44.510 --> 01:46.910
After all, you’re not sick in the first place.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.510
I’m sorry to have alarmed you.

01:50.510 --> 01:57.200
Still, if you don’t understand psychiatry well, you can use it to make all sorts of misguided conclusions.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.330
You can diagnose yourself as being sick.

01:59.330 --> 02:08.400
Most people go to the doctor when they or someone they know can’t carry on their day-to-day activities.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.220
They come in to see a doctor and they are diagnosed or treated, and sometimes they are diagnosed as sick.

02:13.220 --> 02:20.480
So for someone like you, who can continue her own day-to-day activities without a problem, we can’t really say that you are sick unless something’s bad enough that you need hospitalization.
