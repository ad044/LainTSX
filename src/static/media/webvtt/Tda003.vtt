There will be a party at a friend’s home tomorrow, so I made an apple pie.

00:06.440 --> 00:11.620
When I gave Takeshi-san a slice, he said that with a pie as sweet as the one I made, everyone aside from himself at the party would enjoy it.

00:11.620 --> 00:15.430
He said that my baking had become Americanized.

00:17.870 --> 00:22.680
It’s true that compared to the cakes and pies in America, Japanese desserts are usually much less sweet.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.500
At first I didn’t bake things this sweet.

00:28.230 --> 00:30.850
But now, I feel that unless I make my desserts sweet, they would be unsatisfactory.

00:32.690 --> 00:37.560
If I get used to all this sweet stuff, I won’t want to eat pastries when I return to Japan.

00:38.630 --> 00:42.540
If I don’t cool it I could get fat and Takeshi-san won’t like me.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.920
I’ll have to start another diet tomorrow!

00:46.230 --> 00:47.330
Hee, hee.
