Doesn't everyone wish for someone to die sometime?

00:05.820 --> 00:07.860
And you’re saying that you can’t forgive me?

00:09.100 --> 00:11.060
You killed Professor Takashima, didn’t you?

00:12.200 --> 00:14.080
I had nothing to do with it.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.910
The police said that it wasn’t me.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.020
They think it was a suicide.

00:20.260 --> 00:21.200
Please.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.710
Help me.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.710
I understand.

00:26.130 --> 00:30.970
You’re a good girl, aren’t you, Lain?
