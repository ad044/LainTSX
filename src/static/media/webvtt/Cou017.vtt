00:00.450 --> 00:03.140
I’m sorry ma’am.

00:03.140 --> 00:05.340
I can handle it from here.

00:05.340 --> 00:10.900
(pause) Lain, I’m sorry.

00:11.410 --> 00:15.440
I thought that if I didn't do this, your would never see me again.

00:16.530 --> 00:19.940
I just wanted to apologize.

00:20.860 --> 00:23.170
I think I was arrogant about my assumptions about you.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.290
Still, I wanted you to understand and to be comfortable.

00:29.210 --> 00:37.300
I just thought that if you could face your dreams and understand where they were coming from, that they would stop.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.220
I’m sorry, Touko-san.

00:39.220 --> 00:39.780
Why?

00:40.360 --> 00:47.280
I lied to you... I didn’t keep the diary.

00:48.440 --> 00:55.160
That’s okay. I told you that it was all up to you.

00:55.770 --> 00:59.090
You were trying to be helpful to me.

01:00.970 --> 01:09.720
Thank you. I’m grateful that you feel that way. Can you forgive me, Lain?

01:10.460 --> 01:11.140
Yes.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.120
I’m so glad.

01:17.730 --> 01:21.660
I was so sad when you walked away from our session.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.090
I cried.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.340
I felt so bad.

01:26.090 --> 01:27.560
I though you didn’t like me anymore.

01:28.930 --> 01:31.060
Touko-san, don’t cry.

01:31.200 --> 01:38.440
Oh... It’s so silly of me to cry over this. I’m sorry, Lain.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.490
Don’t cry.

01:41.380 --> 01:47.600
These are tears of joy, Lain. I’m so glad.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.250
Joy?

01:50.700 --> 01:53.000
Yes. Tears of joy.

01:53.690 --> 01:58.410
I’m really happy, too. I feel so close to you.
