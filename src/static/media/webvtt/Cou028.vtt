You know about neurosis? Wow, Lain. You’re going to have to start counseling me.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.020
I know the word, not its meaning.

00:13.030 --> 00:13.950
What kind of image?

00:14.900 --> 00:17.950
The mind changes and becomes distorted?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.780
Yes. You’ve got the general idea.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.260
That’s awful. You won’t teach me anymore?

00:24.480 --> 00:24.960
No.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.720
I’m really telling you that you got the general idea.

00:28.830 --> 00:36.310
Neurosis is a state in which there is nothing wrong with a person physically, yet the person has irrational fears and perceives threats.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.270
This places a lot of stress on the person and makes her feel sick.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.270
It’s only inside of their heads?

00:42.660 --> 00:45.320
We used to think so.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.760
But after a lot of research, we think that an imbalance of the autonomic nerves in the brain is related to it.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.910
What I mean is, something is wrong in the body, too.

00:57.430 --> 01:01.670
We used to categorize physical symptoms as psychosomatic.

01:02.310 --> 01:08.160
But we’ve been finding more and more that conditions we thought were only of the mind involve the body itself.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.360
Psychosomatic?

01:11.180 --> 01:14.060
Oh, Lain, if you ask so many questions, your head is going to explode!

01:15.060 --> 01:19.950
You’ve heard about people who lose a lot of weight because of stress, or go bald?

01:20.390 --> 01:21.040
That’s psychosomatic.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.180
Lain, you don’t, by any chance...

01:24.460 --> 01:25.520
No, I don’t have that kind of problem.

01:28.430 --> 01:30.020
Oh, I’m relieved. That was hasty of me!
