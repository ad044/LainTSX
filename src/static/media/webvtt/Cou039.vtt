00:00.000 --> 00:03.550
What kind of research do you do?

00:04.060 --> 00:07.800
Research? I never mentioned that...

00:07.800 --> 00:09.800
But this is a research center, isn’t it?

00:10.750 --> 00:15.240
I’m still an apprentice. I haven’t done any of my own research.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.350
You’re an apprentice after being here for 3 years?

00:18.440 --> 00:20.000
How did you know...

00:20.000 --> 00:23.910
You told me yourself.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.950
I did?

00:27.370 --> 00:28.730
I’m sorry.

00:28.730 --> 00:31.350
Somehow, I haven’t been feeling very good lately.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.040
Could you ask me fewer questions today?

00:35.040 --> 00:38.730
Either that, or can we just not talk quite so much?

00:38.730 --> 00:45.640
You’re tired, Sensei. Maybe you should sleep a little.

00:46.330 --> 00:54.660
Tired? I guess I look that way. You’re right. I must look that way.

00:55.110 --> 00:58.040
I feel bad for you Touko-san.

00:58.060 --> 01:01.370
You can’t do your own research because you’re busy with miscellaneous tasks.

01:01.370 --> 01:03.660
I’m not doing any miscellaneous tasks!

01:04.750 --> 01:06.240
I’m sorry.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.370
I’m sorry for raising my voice like that.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.060
You must be shocked.

01:11.060 --> 01:14.060
Did something happen? Touko-san?

01:14.060 --> 01:15.460
No, nothing.

01:15.460 --> 01:19.480
You’re busy with miscellaneous tasks and can’t do your own research. Does that bother you?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.930
How do you know about... ?

01:20.930 --> 01:22.970
I found the homepage for this research center.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.130
I saw the list of researchers and published dissertations, but I couldn't find you.

01:29.130 --> 01:34.510
That’s right. I haven’t published any dissertations since I came here. But I mean to very soon.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.600
You’re okay now. You have time for your own research now?

01:38.600 --> 01:41.530
What are you saying? What do you mean, Lain?

01:42.040 --> 01:45.220
I’m not a research subject, am I?

01:45.220 --> 01:47.620
That’s why I’m not useful to you.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.820
We can end now if you’d like.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.820
I can’t see them anymore.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.620
I’m wasting your time.

01:57.860 --> 01:58.860
Lain.

01:59.660 --> 02:04.130
You’re like a sister to me.

02:04.130 --> 02:06.910
I’m the one who said that we could just talk.

02:06.910 --> 02:09.080
I don’t think of you as a nuisance.

02:09.080 --> 02:09.750
And...

02:09.750 --> 02:15.550
There’s nothing for you to worry about, Touko-san. It was a suicide.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.550
How do you know about that?

02:17.550 --> 02:22.130
I read it in the paper. It was on the bulletin board here, too.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.910
I see. You’re right.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
What kind of research do you do?

02:30.150 --> 02:38.770
As I said before, I’m trying to develop a new treatment system using my background as a counselor and psychiatrist.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.970
But it looks like I’m failing as a counselor and a psychiatrist right now.

02:43.180 --> 02:44.350
Why?

02:45.020 --> 02:52.080
I think I’m becoming mentally unstable, now. Just a few moments ago, I...I’m sorry.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.600
Touko-san... are you okay?
