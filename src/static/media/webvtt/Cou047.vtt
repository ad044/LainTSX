00:00.460 --> 00:03.060
You’re Lain, aren’t you?

00:03.610 --> 00:06.810
Sure I am. You’re being silly, Touko-san.

00:07.080 --> 00:07.730
Oh, I’m sorry.

00:07.730 --> 00:08.540
You’re right.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.660
I’m a little tired.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.180
I’m sorry for asking goofy questions.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.970
You seem to be really doing well lately, Lain.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.050
I haven’t changed.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.730
We’ve been having counseling sessions for a long time.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.980
A long time? Do you mean many times? Have I been seeing you too much?

00:33.550 --> 00:37.940
Maybe. What do you think?

00:38.580 --> 00:41.050
There seem to be many areas left.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.730
What do you mean? Don't tell me things I can’t understand.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.210
What’s wrong? Are you angry? You can’t control your emotions?

00:51.210 --> 00:56.300
Why are you asking me this! Look, Lain. Are you playing with me? Are you mocking me?

00:56.300 --> 00:57.240
No.

00:57.240 --> 01:01.950
This counseling session is for YOU. You come here to see me. Not the other way around.

01:01.950 --> 01:07.330
But you said that I could talk. I want to know about you.

01:07.330 --> 01:12.300
How is finding out about me going to help you? Do you just want to irritate me?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.660
You really didn’t like my questions?

01:14.660 --> 01:15.420
No, I didn’t!

01:15.420 --> 01:17.310
I want you to leave things alone.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.610
I don’t want you trying to get inside my head.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.200
That’s what I think.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.650
Aren’t you sad to be alone?

01:23.650 --> 01:24.820
I’m not alone!

01:24.820 --> 01:26.380
I am not you!

01:26.380 --> 01:28.250
You are Lain, aren’t you?

01:29.290 --> 01:34.800
You’re the proper, reserved, sad girl without much self-confidence, aren’t you?

01:34.800 --> 01:40.370
No, that’s not me. I think my personality is much different from that.

01:40.370 --> 01:41.480
Then who are you?

01:41.740 --> 01:43.920
I’m... Lain.
