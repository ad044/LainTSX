00:00.860 --> 00:03.860
The ego is your sense of who you are, isn’t it?

00:04.600 --> 00:12.560
Yes, but more technically phrased, the ego is a part of the mind you use to experience as yourself and to recognize yourself.

00:12.970 --> 00:13.690
Do you get it?

00:14.200 --> 00:14.970
Not at all.

00:15.530 --> 00:19.160
Ok, so you have an idea that you are Lain.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.090
In such the structural element, the "EGO" is right there.

00:24.020 --> 00:28.880
Linguistically, "myself" describes all of you, right?

00:29.860 --> 00:36.640
"Ego" is, however, one of the parts of your mind you use to recognize that all of experiences I have had were mine.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.410
Saying "it’s just to realize that you are yourself" is somewhat better to understand?

00:42.260 --> 00:46.040
I can get the last part, but it is still beyond my understanding.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.240
I like your honesty.

00:49.570 --> 00:56.380
So the girl, Lain, has various emotions, such as kindness, loneliness and things like that.

00:57.060 --> 01:00.240
Now the EGO is what is left when you don’t feel any emotions.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.300
I guess I understand a little...

01:04.060 --> 01:10.730
For example, the Lain who woke up this morning and what Lain is now here are the same, right?

01:11.450 --> 01:11.780
Right.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.890
What Lain will be tomorrow should be the same as those.

01:15.650 --> 01:16.580
I guess so.

01:16.970 --> 01:28.560
I mean if your ego works properly, you can recognize that you exist continuously and confirm that that existence is "myself." If your ego doesn’t work properly...

01:28.720 --> 01:29.980
If it doesn’t?

01:30.640 --> 01:33.300
We call such a situation "identity disorder" in the medical field.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.360
On the other hand, there is also an "isolation disorder" which means you think that you are not yourself.

01:39.930 --> 01:42.200
He, he, they sound like bad diseases, don’t they?

01:44.010 --> 01:48.840
Yet anyone your age usually doesn’t complete his or her ego until later.

01:49.890 --> 01:53.640
You just can gradually recognize yourself with age.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.490
So is it wrong to think that I understand myself at my age?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.100
It just happens to be that such things happen all the time.
