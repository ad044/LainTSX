00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
When I decoded a file that came today by e-mail, I saw the image of a dead infant.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.260
I couldn’t find the address the file came from.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.600
I wonder if it’s from the person that started that tasteless online game.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.230
I’m getting scared to open my mail now.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.900
I can’t leave here, though.

00:19.300 --> 00:23.360
At least not until I enter junior high and start an ordinary life.

00:23.930 --> 00:31.830
When I start junior high, and I’ll have friends and I’ll be busy, and I might not have time to come to the net.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.730
I ought to study the net now while I still have time.
