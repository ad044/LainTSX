00:00.230 --> 00:03.660
I’ve relaxed a lot and have been able to look at myself more clearly.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.620
That has made it easier for me to write in my diary.

00:07.630 --> 00:09.260
I can finally see my surroundings.

00:10.360 --> 00:17.970
The reason the jerks at the lab were laughing at me was because they knew about Takeshi-san getting married.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.250
I’m understanding now that I’m the only one who had no clue.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.460
I feel raw and bitter.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.460
I feel miserable.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.490
I am sad.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.400
Takeshi-san.

00:36.510 --> 00:38.020
I can’t work anymore.

00:38.630 --> 00:41.460
I want to throw everything away and quit working at this lab.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.940
I’ll quit counseling Lain.

00:45.050 --> 00:47.270
Lain will be alright without me.

00:48.050 --> 00:48.800
Won’t you, Lain?

00:52.780 --> 00:55.240
Who is going to help me?

00:56.010 --> 00:56.770
Yoshida-kun?

00:59.380 --> 01:02.210
He’s better than Takeshi-san anyway.

01:02.770 --> 01:06.720
He’s young and kind and I want to be held by him.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.100
I wanted to cheat on Takeshi-san.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.440
But that’s a lie, too.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.520
Was I just looking for someone who would need me?

01:19.640 --> 01:21.760
I didn’t know what a weak person I am.

01:24.370 --> 01:25.470
I better head to bed soon.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.400
I’m sure there is a stronger Toko in one of my dreams.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.230
I’ll be different tomorrow.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.550
As long as I go to sleep believing that, I’ll be...
