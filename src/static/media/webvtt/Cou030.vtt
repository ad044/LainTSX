00:00.220 --> 00:04.640
Do you have many memories from your childhood?

00:05.460 --> 00:07.580
Memories? Do you mean records?

00:07.940 --> 00:10.420
Well, memories and records aren’t exactly the same.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.840
Don't think about it too much.

00:13.260 --> 00:16.580
If you’ve traveled somewhere during summer vacation...

00:17.280 --> 00:19.720
I haven’t traveled anywhere during summer vacation.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.860
I’m sorry.

00:22.720 --> 00:29.240
In my youth, both of my parents worked, so I didn’t get to travel very much.

00:29.440 --> 00:35.360
I didn’t like it when I went back to school after vacation and other kids would ask me where I went or what I did during the summer.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.320
What’s the difference between a memory and a record?

00:39.640 --> 00:47.300
From a medical standpoint, a record is something documented that lists exactly what happened, when and where.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.520
A memory is more subjective.

00:49.540 --> 00:51.300
It’s what you remember personally.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.720
It’s something in your mind that you can access from time to time.

00:56.380 --> 00:59.740
But Lain, doesn’t all this stuff bore you?

01:00.280 --> 01:04.340
No. How does a memory enter the brain?

01:05.360 --> 01:11.900
How? That’s a pretty complicated subject. Are you sure you want to get into it?
