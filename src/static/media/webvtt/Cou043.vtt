00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
It’s not a memory. It’s a record.

00:02.900 --> 00:10.520
Well, they’re vaguely similar. But it’s no time to be playing word-games.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.650
You would understand if you were connected.

00:13.650 --> 00:15.900
Connected to what?

00:15.900 --> 00:22.900
Lain, you say that Misato-chan exists, but you are the only person who says so.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.650
How can you expect anyone else to understand?

00:25.650 --> 00:28.150
There is something wrong with this.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.520
How can anyone believe you?

00:29.520 --> 00:30.670
You don't believe me, Toko-san?

00:30.670 --> 00:33.500
Unfortunately, no.

00:33.950 --> 00:38.920
But that’s because I’ve looked very closely into this personally, and all the facts point against it.

00:38.920 --> 00:44.170
If you could show me some objective proof that that I am mistaken, that would be different.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.020
How would I prove that she exists?

00:48.020 --> 00:49.350
How?

00:49.350 --> 00:52.700
Well show me other people who’ve known her.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.370
Show me her identification or birth certificate or something.

00:55.370 --> 00:58.970
More than anything else, show me that she’s a human being that exists and walks around in a human body.

00:58.970 --> 01:01.380
She doesn’t exist if she doesn’t have a human body?

01:01.380 --> 01:04.150
Of course not! She’s not a ghost, is she?

01:04.150 --> 01:07.710
Professor Takashima didn’t exist, then?

01:08.310 --> 01:10.550
But he did exist.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.300
He had a body before he died.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.900
He lived and walked around in a human body.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.490
There is ample evidence that he existed.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.940
Many people who are alive now knew him.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.480
There are records of his existence.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.730
Let’s cool it, Lain.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.000
I’m not here to have a question and answer session with you.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.160
I’m here to treat you.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.720
I do not acknowledge Misato-chan’s existence.
