00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But, what kind of study do you like?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.570
What is college like?

00:03.240 --> 00:05.930
You’re in junior high school now aren’t you, Lain?

00:06.620 --> 00:09.980
So if you’re in junior high and want to keep studying, you go to high school, right?

00:10.500 --> 00:14.050
College is where people go if they want to keep studying after high school.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.180
Do you like to study, Sensei?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.380
I didn’t used to.

00:19.420 --> 00:24.360
But I went to America as an exchange student when I was in junior high school, and I started to feel differently then.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.160
You were an exchange student. Wow!

00:27.460 --> 00:32.340
At the time, I just went because my parents wanted me to.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.850
But people have different ways of seeing things in other countries, and I learned a lot from that.

00:40.040 --> 00:47.930
Looking back, it was a lot of work, and at first, I was very nervous, but now I’m really grateful that I was able to be an exchange student.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.730
I learned English, too.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.010
That’s amazing, Toko Sensei!

00:54.010 --> 00:55.560
Oh, it’s not so amazing.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.410
There are lots of people who have studied much more than I have.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.820
I’m really a pretty lazy person.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.440
I liked to fool around, really.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.500
It’s boring to just study, isn’t it?

01:08.100 --> 01:09.760
Do you like to study, Lain?

01:10.370 --> 01:11.600
Not really.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.600
What subjects don’t you like?

01:14.060 --> 01:15.240
Japanese and physical education.

01:15.930 --> 01:19.380
I see. So you don’t like exercise.

01:19.730 --> 01:22.380
No, I don’t like physical education.

01:23.060 --> 01:24.370
You like exercise, then?

01:24.740 --> 01:25.290
Yes.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.020
What kind of exercise do you like?

01:27.380 --> 01:28.170
The metal beam.

01:28.170 --> 01:29.330
Wow!

01:29.760 --> 01:34.100
I used to like running, but I was never good at the metal beam.

01:34.540 --> 01:37.640
I would spin around and get too dizzy.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.930
I like to spin around.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.770
Both frontwards and backwards?

01:42.930 --> 01:44.040
Yes, both.

01:44.810 --> 01:47.340
What don’t you like?

01:49.890 --> 01:53.200
You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.

01:57.980 --> 01:59.130
I'm sorry.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.010
Are you tired?

02:00.860 --> 02:04.060
Why don't we end early today?
