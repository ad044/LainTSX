00:00.000 --> 00:03.020
I met Lain for the second time today.

00:03.620 --> 00:10.770
She looked right at me and called me "sensei." That made me feel good, and I blushed.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.600
I wonder if I’ve become transparent to her already.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.450
I must be an inexperienced counselor if I blush just because I’m called a sensei.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.520
From the first time I met Lain, I had an unusual sense about her.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.970
I wonder what that was.

00:29.740 --> 00:34.590
When I look at her eyes, I feel as though she can see right through me.

00:35.760 --> 00:41.310
I wonder if she feels that I am someone that can help her.

00:41.960 --> 00:54.240
I don’t remember myself being as relaxed as Lain when I was her age.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.560
She seems very composed.

01:01.060 --> 01:06.960
A 12-year-old is still a child, but Lain seems like an adult.

01:06.960 --> 01:15.140
They say that kids are all getting precocious these days.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.940
I guess times are changing.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.410
Ah!

01:19.410 --> 01:21.690
Now I’m talking like an old woman.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.940
Don’t let any hallucinations beat you, Lain!

01:26.650 --> 01:28.880
I’m going to make you well.
