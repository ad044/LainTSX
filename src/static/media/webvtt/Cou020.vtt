00:00.220 --> 00:01.210
Good morning, Lain.

00:01.840 --> 00:03.830
Good morning, Toko-san.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.910
Have you seen anything since then?

00:06.360 --> 00:09.490
No, I haven’t. Honestly.

00:09.870 --> 00:11.160
Have you heard anything?

00:11.640 --> 00:15.300
Sometimes I hear something very confused.

00:15.870 --> 00:20.150
Very confused? One person? More than one?

00:20.550 --> 00:24.770
More than one. Men and women.

00:24.770 --> 00:26.770
Are they people you know?

00:26.770 --> 00:28.620
Probably not.

00:29.020 --> 00:34.200
You said that you heard things from the sky. What do you think is in the sky?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.640
There’s air.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.840
Uh, huh. And aside from that?

00:39.290 --> 00:43.350
Clouds. The sun. The stars.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.900
Do you know about the radio waves for TV and cell phones?

00:47.300 --> 00:50.480
Yes. The information travels wirelessly?

00:50.480 --> 00:52.960
Right. The information flies through the sky.

00:53.890 --> 00:56.700
Am I hearing that information?

00:56.700 --> 01:02.010
Hmm. It might be that you imagine you are hearing that information.

01:02.010 --> 01:04.170
There’s a sickness like that?

01:05.000 --> 01:05.940
There is.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.940
It’s called delusion.

01:08.730 --> 01:12.800
It’s a symptom of schizophrenia and neurosis.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.410
In simple terms, such symptoms may appear when you concentrate too much on something or feel stressed.

01:18.790 --> 01:19.550
But...

01:19.850 --> 01:20.630
But?

01:21.100 --> 01:25.520
Most of the time, you will hear things that are related to you, to some extent.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.700
For instance, they hear voices that bad-mouth them.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.570
Delusion of persecution?

01:30.570 --> 01:31.360
Right.

01:32.110 --> 01:34.470
You’ve been studying up on this stuff.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.730
Ok. I’ll fill you in a little more on this.

01:39.440 --> 01:54.150
The definition of "delusion" is taking a mistaken idea and believing in your own mind that it is correct.

01:54.460 --> 02:00.020
But for you, Lain, you say that you might have felt or sensed something.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.680
You don't have conviction in your feelings, so they aren't delusions.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.200
You have thoughts, in technical term, we call it delusional ideation.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.440
Delusional ideation?

02:08.600 --> 02:11.880
You can forget that phrase if you’d like.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.880
As I mentioned before, a delusion is generally something intertwined with one’s self.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.970
Most of the time, there are no delusions that don't involve me.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.440
I’m not delusional?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.280
Fundamentally, no.

02:25.280 --> 02:33.040
Still, there are all sorts of delusions, and if you try to "pin" one of them onto someone, you may start pinning other ones on that person, too.
