00:00.000 --> 00:03.150
You’re really yearning all the time, aren’t you, Lain?

00:03.730 --> 00:04.860
Probably...

00:05.400 --> 00:07.600
I’m envious.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.770
Human perception is a wild thing.

00:10.770 --> 00:14.350
If you start feeling something, you start believing it.

00:14.350 --> 00:18.400
I don't know how to explain to anyone that I am really me.

00:19.040 --> 00:25.200
But being able to question that sense of self is a special talent.

00:25.730 --> 00:28.220
I don’t want a talent like that.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.170
Yeah.

00:29.170 --> 00:32.280
I’m sure you feel really strongly that way right now.

00:33.060 --> 00:37.710
But I feel that it can be a good thing for you, too.

00:37.710 --> 00:47.220
I don't understand it well right now, but I think that if you can include and accept that as part of yourself, it would help you in the long run.

00:47.220 --> 00:49.310
I won’t change?

00:49.310 --> 00:50.950
I don’t know.

00:50.950 --> 00:56.640
You might change naturally and stop having nightmares.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.130
If that happens, you’d be like most other kids.

01:00.130 --> 01:06.220
But I won’t know if I’ve gotten better. I might have nightmares again.

01:06.220 --> 01:10.480
Yeah. But things will change from now on.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.280
What do you mean?

01:12.280 --> 01:18.840
I mean that you’re not alone. I’m here, and you can talk to me about things.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.730
That’s true, Touko-san.
