00:00.680 --> 00:03.500
I felt really good today.

00:04.020 --> 00:06.820
That’s really great, Toko-san.

00:07.310 --> 00:14.560
I’m starting to feel worse, though. I can’t tell what’s bothering me.

00:15.070 --> 00:18.890
Is it something vague? Something about feeling dormant?

00:19.680 --> 00:24.890
When you’re feeling happy, don’t you sometimes feel worried about when it might come to an end?

00:25.330 --> 00:29.720
Is that a symptom of an intermittent flow of thought?

00:30.520 --> 00:33.470
I can’t imagine myself being happy.

00:33.470 --> 00:35.530
You can imagine yourself being unhappy?

00:36.610 --> 00:40.430
I suppose. But I can’t get rid of the worry.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.730
Is there something I can do?

00:42.730 --> 00:47.770
What would I want to seek for from you? Why me from you?

00:47.770 --> 00:49.260
Are you too proud to tell me?

00:49.260 --> 00:54.890
It has nothing to do with pride. Why don’t you tell me what you think is going on with me.

00:54.890 --> 00:57.120
You’re just Toko-san. You’re yourself.

00:57.120 --> 01:07.200
That’s right. I better get to my reports. If you want, you can stay around here, but I have to go.

01:07.630 --> 01:08.480
Why?

01:08.480 --> 01:10.180
Because there is something I have to do right now.

01:10.180 --> 01:11.540
There is something that I can only do now.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.600
I have to continue my research.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.230
That makes you happy?

01:15.230 --> 01:19.290
Yes, it does. My number one goal is to continue doing the research that I enjoy.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.260
So that’s number one?

01:21.260 --> 01:22.000
No.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.150
That’s not what I mean.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.250
Seeing you is very important, too.

01:23.610 --> 01:29.470
It’s very important to me that everything goes well.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.880
But I have to do things in order.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.390
I’m glad.
