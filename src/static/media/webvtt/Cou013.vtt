Hello, Toko-san.

00:02.100 --> 00:03.450
Hello, Lain.

00:04.090 --> 00:07.050
Ok, from today we’re going to really tackle what’s bothering you, Lain-chan.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.330
I’m sorry.

00:08.330 --> 00:09.340
I mean Lain.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.500
We’re going to try to figure things out so you don’t see nightmares anymore.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.680
Uh, huh. I haven’t seen nightmares much lately, though. Sometimes I hear things, though.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.960
Hear things? Like what?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.290
I don’t know.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.170
It sounds like someone talking.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.620
I don’t like hearing it, so I try my best to ignore it.

00:26.980 --> 00:31.000
Hmm. Do you know whose voice you hear?

00:31.410 --> 00:36.170
I don’t know. It can be a man’s voice or a woman’s voice.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.930
Where do the voices seem to come from?

00:40.420 --> 00:41.130
From the sky.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.940
The sky? From what part of the sky?

00:45.580 --> 00:49.220
From the electric lines. Somehow...

00:49.410 --> 00:56.020
The electric lines... Do you know what’s in side of electric lines?

00:56.760 --> 00:59.860
Wiring that carries electricity.

01:00.060 --> 01:06.640
Right. They carry electricity that comes from power plants. Do feel like you sense electricity?

01:07.220 --> 01:13.820
I don't really know. Sometimes it seems to come from the sky; not the electric lines.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.650
Are you bothered by it right now?

01:17.420 --> 01:21.640
No. I’m not scared now. But...

01:21.960 --> 01:26.240
When you told your mother, did she tell you not to tell anyone else about these things?

01:26.880 --> 01:27.460
Uh huh.

01:27.730 --> 01:32.460
People who don’t hear these things would think strange things about you if you told them, huh?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.780
You don’t have to worry about telling me anything you want to.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.370
You don’t have to worry, Ok?

01:37.540 --> 01:40.060
I’m not going to think strange things about you.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.730
Because I’m sick?

01:41.880 --> 01:49.040
No, Lain. Let’s see. You know about "kanashibari?"

01:49.600 --> 01:52.450
When a ghost comes out and you can’t move your body?

01:52.660 --> 01:55.120
Right. Have you ever had that happen to you?

01:55.540 --> 01:56.700
Many times.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.970
It was frightening, wasn’t it?

01:58.300 --> 01:58.890
Uh, huh.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.780
Do you know why kanashibari happens?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.100
Why?

02:02.580 --> 02:04.340
The human body is very mysterious.

02:04.850 --> 02:13.080
When you’re sleeping, there are times when your mind is awake, times when your body is awake.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.090
Do you understand?

02:14.770 --> 02:15.890
Sort of...

02:16.130 --> 02:20.570
Well, that’s good enough for now. What parts of you are awake right now?

02:21.080 --> 02:22.360
My body and my mind.

02:22.530 --> 02:23.060
Hmm.

02:23.820 --> 02:29.100
Suppose I said something really scary right now and you feel scared enough to run out of this room.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.440
What would you do?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.290
I think I would run out of this room.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.020
Ok.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.090
Suppose that you feel so scared that you want to run out of this room, but your body is asleep and you can’t move.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.060
That’s what kanashibari is.

02:39.160 --> 02:45.400
So if you’re having a nightmare but your body is asleep and you can’t move, you are having kanashibari.

02:46.130 --> 02:46.780
You see?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.220
If you know what’s involved, it’s not so scary, is it?

02:49.660 --> 02:51.380
No. It isn’t.
