00:00.000 --> 00:02.910
I got an e-mail from the editors today.

00:02.910 --> 00:04.140
I’m glad.

00:04.140 --> 00:06.140
Misato-chan’s artwork came first.

00:06.570 --> 00:11.710
I saw her sketch over 2 months before the other one was published.

00:12.060 --> 00:15.820
Could this sort of thing happen often?

00:16.200 --> 00:20.840
The same picture at the same time, both by a Japanese, all by coincidence?

00:21.230 --> 00:24.000
What is that other artist like?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.380
I couldn’t find a home page for her.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.880
I wish I had information about her.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.730
I know that Misato-chan was right all along, and I feel much better now.

00:33.230 --> 00:36.160
I’ll go to Misato-chan’s home tomorrow.
