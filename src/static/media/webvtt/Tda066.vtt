00:00.820 --> 00:04.770
Today I came face to face with Takeshi-san at the lab.

00:05.960 --> 00:10.060
My heart beat so fast!

00:11.630 --> 00:15.140
I wondered if he would pretend that he wasn’t married to someone else.

00:15.250 --> 00:19.300
I suddenly froze; I couldn’t move my body or my face.

00:21.010 --> 00:29.100
Takeshi-san smiled and just said, "Hey, you look really good." Is that all?

00:29.900 --> 00:33.450
Is that all you have to say to me?

00:35.670 --> 00:39.030
The next moment, I found myself starting to laugh.

00:40.770 --> 00:44.740
Takeshi-san was surprised and ran away.

00:47.060 --> 00:47.750
I wonder why.

00:48.630 --> 00:50.590
Why did I laugh?

00:52.610 --> 00:55.500
Did Takeshi-san think that I went crazy?

00:57.580 --> 00:59.740
Is there really something wrong with my mind?

01:00.580 --> 01:02.660
Could this all be a dream?

01:07.520 --> 01:11.580
Sometimes I can’t tell what’s real or what’s a dream.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.860
Someone...help me.
