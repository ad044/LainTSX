00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
I have to do a drawing for a cultural festival soon.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.120
I wonder what to draw.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.980
I’m not sure.

00:09.860 --> 00:13.920
One of the leaders said that it can be something simple.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.240
I wonder what.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.440
A drawing of Bike-chan?

00:17.440 --> 00:19.340
Misato-chan?

00:19.340 --> 00:21.340
Dad, Mom?

00:21.340 --> 00:22.700
Toko-san?

00:22.700 --> 00:23.820
Myself?

00:24.620 --> 00:26.800
It’s difficult to draw people.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.680
If the drawing doesn’t look like the person, it’s embarrassing.
